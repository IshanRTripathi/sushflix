Questions Before Starting:
Should the modal be full-screen or a smaller dialog? => smaller but just enough to have all components in it, not too small but not big eiter
Which fields should be editable? => 
on top will be profilepicture component which will have a upload button, name, bio can be editable
Any specific validation rules? profile picture validation is already implemented, no other validations to any field, max character count can be 200
Should we show a preview of the new profile picture before saving? yes when we click on the upload icon and select the image, the image will be shown and when save button in the edit modal will be clicked, the api calls will be made respectively for profile picture and profile update
Any specific styling requirements? should be similar to how other social media platforms have it, clean simple but easy to modify with loose coupling
