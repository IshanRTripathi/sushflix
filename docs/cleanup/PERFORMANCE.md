### Bundle Analysis (2025-05-13)
- **Total JavaScript Size**: 1.03 MB
- **Main Bundles**:
  - index-B2MpR3te.js: 372.45 KB (35.21%)
  - ui-CUhXATzi.js: 326.53 KB (30.86%)
  - react-fk8qV8eW.js: 324.31 KB (30.66%)
  - vendor-rSMZb3Ae.js: 34.04 KB (3.22%)

#### Key Findings
- Bundle size exceeds recommended 500KB limit
- Multiple large individual files
- Potential for code splitting and lazy loading

## Performance Optimization Plan

### Immediate Focus Areas
1. **Code Splitting**
   - [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
   - [ ] Analyze and split large components
   - [ ] Set up dynamic imports for non-critical features

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - [ ] Review large dependencies in the main bundles
   - [ ] Check for duplicate dependencies
   - [ ] Consider lighter alternatives for heavy libraries

3. **Build Optimization**
   - [ ] Configure production optimizations
   - [ ] Enable compression (Brotli + Gzip)
   - [ ] Set up proper caching headers

### 1. Bundle Analysis & Optimization
- [ ] Set up bundle analysis tool (source-map-explorer or webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- [ ] Analyze current bundle size and composition
- [ ] Identify and remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Optimize third-party libraries (moment.js → date-fns, lodash → lodash-es)
- [ ] Configure tree-shaking and sideEffects in package.json
- [ ] Implement proper chunking strategy

### 2. Render Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile component rendering with React DevTools
- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Use useCallback/useMemo for expensive calculations
- [ ] Implement windowing/virtualization for long lists (react-window or react-virtualized)
- [ ] Optimize context providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Optimize CSS-in-JS usage (if applicable)

### 3. Network & API Optimization
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- [ ] Set up API response caching
- [ ] Optimize GraphQL queries (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement request deduplication
- [ ] Set up proper compression (Brotli + Gzip)
- [ ] Implement prefetching for critical resources
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket usage (if applicable)

### 4. Asset Optimization
- [ ] Convert images to WebP/AVIF format
- [ ] Implement responsive images with srcset
- [ ] Lazy load below-the-fold images and iframes
- [ ] Optimize and subset font files
- [ ] Implement font-display: swap
- [ ] Preload critical assets
- [ ] Optimize and minify SVGs

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Performance Measurement**
   - Set up Web Vitals monitoring
   - Configure Lighthouse CI
   - Establish performance budgets
   - Set up RUM (Real User Monitoring)

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Implement core functionality first
   - Enhance with JavaScript progressively
   - Ensure critical CSS is inlined
   - Implement service worker for offline support

3. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Create performance regression tests
   - Document performance budgets
   - Regular performance audits

## Common Performance Issues to Address
- Large bundle size
- Unoptimized images
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Unoptimized API calls
