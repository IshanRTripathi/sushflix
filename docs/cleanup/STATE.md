# State Management Cleanup

## Overview
This document tracks the cleanup and optimization of state management in the application.

## Current Status
- **Status**: Scheduled for Phase 2
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-12
- **Target Directories**: 
  - `/src/contexts`
  - `/src/hooks` (state-related hooks)
  - `/src/store` (if applicable)

## Dependencies
- Components Audit (Phase 1) must be completed first
- Types Cleanup (Phase 1) should be completed for better type safety

## State Management Inventory

### Context Providers
| Context | File | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Auth | `AuthContext.tsx` | Will audit in Phase 2 | Handles user authentication |
| Theme | `ThemeContext.tsx` | Will audit in Phase 2 | Manages app theme |
| Notifications | `NotificationContext.tsx` | Will audit in Phase 2 | Handles app-wide notifications |

### State Hooks
| Hook | File | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| useAuth | `useAuth.ts` | Will audit in Phase 2 | Authentication state |
| useLocalStorage | `useLocalStorage.ts` | Will audit in Phase 2 | Local storage persistence |
| useMediaQuery | `useMediaQuery.ts` | Will audit in Phase 2 | Responsive design helpers |

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Context Usage
- [ ] Identify unnecessary context usage
- [ ] Optimize context providers
- [ ] Check for context nesting issues
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup

### 2. State Organization
- [ ] Group related state
- [ ] Remove unused state
- [ ] Optimize state updates
- [ ] Check for state duplication

### 3. Performance
- [ ] Memoize selectors
- [ ] Optimize re-renders
- [ ] Implement proper batching
- [ ] Check for unnecessary state updates

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Implement error states
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Log state-related errors

## Common Issues to Address
- Unnecessary context re-renders
- State duplication
- Missing error boundaries
- Lack of loading states

## Action Items

### Phase 1 Preparation (Blocked by Components Audit)
1. Document all state-related components and hooks
2. Identify state management patterns in use
3. Create an inventory of all stateful operations

### Phase 2 Implementation (After Components Audit)
1. Audit all context providers for:
   - Performance optimizations
   - Proper error boundaries
   - Loading states
   - Memory management

2. Optimize state updates by:
   - Implementing useMemo/useCallback where needed
   - Batching state updates
   - Reducing unnecessary re-renders

3. Documentation:
   - Document state management patterns
   - Create state transition diagrams
   - Document common state-related issues and solutions

## Progress Log

### 2025-05-12
- Initial documentation created
- State management audit scheduled for Phase 2
- Blocked by completion of Components Audit (Phase 1)

### Next Steps
1. Complete Components Audit (Phase 1)
2. Begin Types Cleanup (Phase 1)
3. Schedule State Management audit for Phase 2

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test state updates
- [ ] Add test coverage
- [ ] Document test cases
- [ ] Verify edge cases
