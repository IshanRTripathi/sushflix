#### Context Providers
| Context | File | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Auth | `components/auth/AuthContext.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Handles user authentication. Consolidated from duplicate implementations |
| Loading | `contexts/LoadingContext.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Manages loading states across the application. Replaced multiple context implementations |
| Theme | `theme/` | ✅ Complete | Manages app theme. Refactored to a modular structure with improved type safety and documentation |
| Notifications | `NotificationContext.tsx` | 🔍 To Audit | Handles app-wide notifications |
| UI State | `contexts/UIContext.tsx` | ✅ Complete | Centralized management of UI state (modals, menus, sidebar) with proper TypeScript support |

## UI State Management Implementation (2025-05-14)

### Overview
Implemented a centralized UI state management system using React Context to manage all UI-related state across the application. This includes:

- Sidebar state (open/closed)
- Mobile menu state
- Modal dialogs
- Toast notifications
- Loading states

### Key Components

1. **UIContext**
   - Central hub for all UI-related state
   - Provides type-safe access to UI state and actions
   - Handles state updates and subscriptions

2. **Updated Components**
   - AppLayout: Uses UIContext for managing modals and overlays
   - Navigation: Uses UIContext for mobile menu state
   - Sidebar: Integrated with UIContext for responsive behavior
   - MoreMenu: Uses UIContext for consistent state management

3. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `/docs/architecture/UI_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md`
   - Updated README with link to documentation
   - Added JSDoc comments to all new code

### Benefits
- Centralized state management for UI
- Improved type safety with TypeScript
- Better performance with optimized re-renders
- Consistent behavior across the application
- Easier to maintain and extend

## Theme System Refactoring (Completed 2025-05-13)

The theme system has been completely refactored into a modular, type-safe architecture with the following structure:

### Core Components
- **ThemeProvider**: React context provider that integrates with Material-UI theming
- **ThemeManager**: Singleton class handling theme state, persistence, and system preference detection
- **useTheme**: Custom hook providing type-safe access to theme context and utilities

### Directory Structure
```
src/theme/
├── components/           # Theme-related React components
│   └── ThemeProvider.tsx # Main theme provider component
├── context/              # Theme context definitions
│   └── ThemeContext.ts   # Context and types
├── hooks/                # Custom hooks
│   └── useTheme.ts       # useTheme hook implementation
├── managers/             # Business logic
│   └── ThemeManager.ts   # Theme state management
│   └── ThemeManager.ts
├── themes/               # Theme definitions
│   ├── base.ts           # Base theme configuration
│   ├── dark.ts           # Dark theme
│   ├── index.ts          # Theme exports
│   └── light.ts          # Light theme
├── types/                # TypeScript type definitions
│   └── index.ts
└── index.ts              # Public API
```

#### Key Features
- Light/Dark/System theme modes
- System preference detection
- Persistent theme settings
- Type-safe theme API
- Optimized re-renders
- Comprehensive documentation

#### Usage Example
```typescript
import { useTheme } from '../../theme';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, isDark, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
        Switch to {isDark ? 'Light' : 'Dark'} Mode
      </button>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

For more details on the theme system, refer to the [Theme System Architecture](#theme-system-architecture) section above.

### State Hooks
| Hook | File | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| useAuth | `useAuth.ts` | 🔍 To Audit | Authentication state |
| useLocalStorage | `useLocalStorage.ts` | 🔍 To Audit | Local storage persistence |
| useMediaQuery | `useMediaQuery.ts` | 🔍 To Audit | Responsive design helpers |
| useForm | `useForm.ts` | 🔍 To Audit | Form state management |
| useToggle | `useToggle.ts` | 🔍 To Audit | Boolean state toggling |

## Audit Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- [x] Identify all state management solutions in use
- [x] Document current state management patterns
- [x] Map component-state relationships
- [x] Identify potential performance bottlenecks

### 2. State Management Audit

#### Context Usage
- [ ] Identify unnecessary context usage
- [ ] Optimize context providers
- [ ] Check for context nesting issues
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup
- [ ] Document context usage patterns

#### State Organization
- [ ] Group related state
- [ ] Remove unused state
- [ ] Optimize state updates
- [ ] Check for state duplication
- [ ] Document state structure

#### Performance
- [ ] Memoize selectors
- [ ] Optimize re-renders
- [ ] Implement proper batching
- [ ] Measure render performance
- [ ] Document performance considerations
- [ ] Check for unnecessary state updates

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Implement error states
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Log state-related errors

## Common Issues to Address
- Unnecessary context re-renders
- State duplication

## Next Steps

### 1. Performance Optimization (Implemented)
- ✅ Memoized theme object to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Efficient event listener management in ThemeManager
- ✅ Optimized theme switching with minimal re-renders
- ✅ System preference detection without performance overhead

### 2. Testing (High Priority)

- [ ] Add integration tests for ThemeProvider
- [ ] Test theme persistence and system preference detection

### 3. Documentation (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add JSDoc to all theme components
- [ ] Create usage examples in Storybook
- [ ] Document theming guidelines for new components

### 4. Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
- [ ] Add support for custom themes
- [ ] Implement theme color customization
- [ ] Add theme transition animations

### Phase 2 Implementation (After Components Audit)
1. Audit all context providers for:
   - Performance optimizations
   - Proper error boundaries
   - Loading states
   - Memory management

2. Optimize state updates by:
   - Implementing useMemo/useCallback where needed
   - Batching state updates
   - Reducing unnecessary re-renders

3. Documentation:
   - Document state management patterns
   - Create state transition diagrams
   - Document common state-related issues and solutions
