Please analyze and improve the code quality of the attached file according to our code quality roadmap. Focus on implementing the following aspects:

1. Documentation:
   - Add single line comment at the file level explaining the file's purpose at the top of the file
   - Keep comments concise - use one-liner descriptions for functions and components
   - Document all public APIs and interfaces with proper parameters and return types
   - Document any dependencies or external integrations

2. Code Structure:
   - Review and standardize naming conventions
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns
   - Group related functionality together
   - Remove any hardcoded values and move them to configuration
   - Extract common endpoints/URLs into constants at the top of the file

3. TypeScript Quality:
   - Add proper type annotations
   - Implement strict type checking
   - Remove any type assertions
   - Create necessary interfaces and types

4. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add appropriate try-catch blocks
   - Document error conditions
   - Add proper error logging

5. Logging:
   - Add structured logging where needed
   - Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Log important state changes and errors
   - Add performance monitoring if relevant

6. Best Practices:
   - Remove any hardcoded values
   - Implement proper dependency injection
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Add proper validation for inputs

Additional Guidelines:
- Keep comments concise - use one-liner descriptions for functions and components
- Extract common endpoints/URLs into constants at the top of the file using `as const` for type safety
- Group related functionality together
- Maintain proper TypeScript types
- Keep logging for debugging and monitoring
- If the files end up having lines more than 200, create new files with appropriate naming

Please provide a summary of the changes made and mark the progress in the CODE_QUALITY_ROADMAP.md file. Also, document any potential issues or areas that need further attention.
