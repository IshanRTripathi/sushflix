After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several areas for improvement in the user-related entities:

1. Duplicate Interfaces
Issue: There are multiple IUser and IUserProfile interfaces in different locations (e.g., shared/types/database.ts and profile/service/models/).
Fix: Consolidate these into a single source of truth, likely in shared/types, and extend them as needed.
2. Inconsistent Type Usage
Issue: Some components use User from shared/types while others use IUser from models.
Fix: Standardize on one approach, preferably using interfaces from shared/types in the frontend and models in the backend.
3. Missing Documentation
Issue: Some interfaces lack JSDoc comments, making it harder to understand their purpose.
Fix: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all interfaces.
4. Type Safety in Auth Flow
Issue: The auth flow has type assertions (as any) that bypass TypeScript's type checking.
Fix: Replace these with proper type guards or interfaces.
5. Redundant Fields
Issue: Some interfaces have overlapping or redundant fields (e.g., profilePicture vs. avatarUrl).
Fix: Standardize field names across all interfaces.
6. Missing Validation
Issue: Some interfaces lack runtime validation.
Fix: Add validation using a library like zod or class-validator.
7. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
Issue: Mix of camelCase and snake_case in interfaces.
Fix: Standardize on camelCase for all interfaces.
8. Separation of Concerns
Issue: Some interfaces mix database concerns with business logic.
Fix: Separate database models from DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
9. Missing Index Files
Issue: Some modules lack index.ts files for cleaner imports.
Fix: Add index.ts files to export public APIs.
10. Type Extensions
Issue: Some interfaces extend others without clear documentation.
Fix: Document the extension hierarchy and reasons for extension.
