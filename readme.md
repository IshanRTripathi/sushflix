## Deployment Instructions

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The build output will be in the `dist` directory.

3. Deploy to Netlify:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `dist`
   - Set environment variables:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=your_backend_url
     ```

### Backend Deployment (AWS)

1. Set up an EC2 instance:
   - Choose Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
   - Configure security groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic
   - Set up SSH access

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm nginx
   ```

3. Clone your repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone your_repository_url
   cd your_project
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/environment
   ```
   Add:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
   JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret"
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"
   ```

5. Set up PM2 for process management:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start npm --name "api" -- start
   pm2 startup
   ```

6. Configure Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```
   Add:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

7. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com
   ```

8. Restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx```
   ```

9. Set up database backups:
   ```bash
   # Create backup script
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/backup-db.sh
   ```
   Add:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   pg_dump your_database > /backups/db-$DATE.sql
   ```
   ```bash
   # Make executable
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup-db.sh
   
   # Add to crontab
   sudo crontab -e
   ```
   Add:
   ```
   0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-db.sh
   ```

10. Monitor logs:
    ```bash
    pm2 logs
    sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
    ```

### Database Setup (MongoDB Atlas)

1. Create MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. Configure network access and database user
3. Get connection string and update environment variables
4. Set up database indexes:
   ```javascript
   db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 }, { unique: true })
   db.users.createIndex({ "username": 1 }, { unique: true })
   db.content.createIndex({ "creatorId": 1 })
   db.subscriptions.createIndex({ "userId": 1, "creatorId": 1 })
   ```

### Storage Setup (AWS S3)

1. Create S3 bucket:
   - Enable versioning
   - Configure CORS
   - Set up lifecycle rules for old content

2. Create IAM user with S3 access:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:DeleteObject"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Update environment variables with S3 credentials:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
   ```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up monitoring with CloudWatch:
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Disk space
   - Network traffic

2. Configure alerts:
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
     --alarm-name cpu-utilization \
     --alarm-description "CPU utilization exceeded 80%" \
     --metric-name CPUUtilization \
     --namespace AWS/EC2 \
     --statistic Average \
     --period 300 \
     --threshold 80 \
     --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
     --evaluation-periods 2 \
     --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:topic-name
   ```

3. Regular maintenance tasks:
   - Update dependencies monthly
   - Rotate SSL certificates
   - Review and rotate access keys
   - Check and optimize database indexes
   - Monitor storage usage and clean up unused files

### Security Considerations

1. Enable AWS WAF:
   - Rate limiting
   - IP blacklisting
   - SQL injection protection
   - XSS protection

2. Regular security updates:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. Configure backup retention:
   ```bash
   # Set up S3 lifecycle rules
   aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
     --bucket your-bucket-name \
     --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
   ```

4. Set up logging and monitoring:
   ```bash
   # Install and configure fail2ban
   sudo apt install fail2ban
   sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   ```

Remember to:
- Regularly update SSL certificates
- Monitor server resources
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security logs
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Monitor API performance and errors


main.tsx:
The entry point file for the React application. It typically renders the root component (often <App />) into the DOM.
App.tsx:
This file likely contains the main application component that serves as a container for other components. It could include routing logic and the overall structure of the app.

components:
subscription\SubscriptionPlans.tsx:
Likely contains a React component that manages and displays different subscription plans available to users.
pages\HomePage.tsx:
Likely contains a React component representing the home page of the application. This may include an overview of available content and navigation to other parts of the app.
layout\Navigation.tsx:
Likely contains a React component for navigation, such as a menu or header, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the application.

Auth Directory
AuthContext.tsx:
Contains authentication context and logic for managing user authentication state and authentication-related functions in the application

Creator Directory
CreatorProfile.tsx:
Displays the profile of a content creator, showcasing information such as name, bio, and a list of content created by the user.

Content Directory
ContentCard.tsx:
Displays a card for content including details like title, description, and possibly an image or thumbnail.
ContentCategories.tsx:
Displays and manages content categories, allowing users to filter or browse different categories.
ContentDetail.tsx:
Shows detailed information about a specific piece of content, probably including title, description, creator details, and other metadata.
ContentUploadForm.tsx:
Provides a form interface for users to upload new content, including details like title, description, and file upload capabilities.




Firstly, go through each file I modified manually and get an understanding of what new features I added.

1. Generate code for a content upload form that allows creators to upload images or videos, set titles, descriptions, and choose visibility settings. Handle file uploads and sending data to the backend using the Fetch API.

2. Generate code for a creator profile page that displays the creator's profile picture, name, bio, subscription options, and a list of their content. Handle authentication and subscription status for displaying exclusive content.

3. Remove the existing subscription logic, we dont provide subscription to users like we sell apps, this subscription model is specific to each creator, means the creator will have their subscription prices listed.

4. the creator can provide 3 level of subscription, level0 which is free for all followers, but level1 will cost $1.99, level2 $4.99 and level3 $9.99 as they will be called subscribers

5. Each user will have a certain subscription plan of a creator. it could be level1,2,3 and by default level0 if they're following the creator

6. When the subscribe button is clicked, the card view will be shown  of different creators who provide subscription based content.

1. For time being, allow creator signin for username - creator and password- creator
   For user signin, username -user and password - user

2. the creator should be able to see the number of followers they have, number of subscribers, total revenue generated, all the posts they have posted

3. when I click on like and comment button, there should be validations, including one that the person is logged in. The like feature works fine, but the comment functionality is not yet complete. when i comment on a post, it should be visible. Same goes for the follow button on the card, if i click on follow, the follow should change to following.

4. once done, give a comprehensive list of features that still need to be implemented as part of mvp.
